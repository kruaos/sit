        Today, a printed letter is usually reserved for important professional communications, such as recommendation letters, job cover letters, resignation letters, legal correspondence, and company communications. Since it's a formal mode of communication, you'll want to know how to write a letter that is viewed professionally.


Correct formatting is especially important if you're sending a hard copy to the recipient rather than an email as the letter needs to fit the page and look good.


The following sample letter format illustrates the information you need to include when writing a letter, along with advice on the appropriate font, salutation, spacing, closing, and signature for business correspondence.


Sample Letter Format
Contact Information (Your contact information, unless you are writing on letterhead that includes your contact information already, then you do not need to include it.)
Your Name
Your Address
Your City, State Zip Code
Your Phone Number
Your Email Address

Date


Contact Information (The person or company you are writing to)
Name
Title
Company
Address
City, State Zip Code


Greeting (Salutation Examples)

Dear Mr./Ms. Last Name: (Use a formal salutation, not a first name, unless you know the person extremely well. If you do not know the person's gender, you can write out their full name. For instance, "Dear Pat Crody" instead of "Dear Mr. Crody" or "Dear Ms. Crody." Note that the person's name is always followed by a colon (:) in a business letter, and not a comma. If you do not know the recipient’s name, it’s still common and acceptable to use the old-fashioned “To Whom It May Concern:”).

Body of Letter

The first paragraph of your letter should provide an introduction as to why you are writing so that your reason for contacting the person is obvious from the beginning.

Then, in the following paragraphs, provide more information and specific details about your request or the information you are providing.

The last paragraph of your letter should reiterate the reason you are writing and thank the reader for reviewing your request. If appropriate, it should also politely ask for a written response or for the opportunity to arrange a meeting to further discuss your request.

Closing

Best regards, (Closing Examples)

Signature

Handwritten Signature (For a hard copy letter, use blue or black ink to sign the letter)

Typed Signature

Sample Letter
Here is a sample resignation letter using the formatting tips outlined above. You can download the letter template (compatible with Google Docs and Word Online) or see the sample below. Note that in this example, Nicole knows Jason Andrews well enough to use his first name in the salutation.
